# Definition of the licenses used on this project and to what files
# they should apply.
licenses:
  # Either a regex or the string "any" to determine to what files this
  # license should apply. It is common for projects to have files
  # under multiple licenses or with multiple copyright holders. This
  # provides the ability to automatically license files correctly
  # based on their file paths.
  #
  # If "any" is provided all files will match this license.
